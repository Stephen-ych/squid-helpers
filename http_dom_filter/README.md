http_dom_filter
---------------
This is a part of a filtering solution that is suppose to give concurrency in couple levels, client side usig Golang version and server.

This is the client to an http API which is compatible in V2 also with riak.

For now I am releasing the client side the has I found out is similar to: https://github.com/arthurtumanyan/sqRiakRedirector .

Later I will try to add the server side code the is an API to a PGSQL DB.
