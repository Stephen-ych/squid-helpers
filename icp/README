icp_client
==========
icp_client.rb is based on:          

Internet Cache Protocol (ICP), version 2
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2186 

and
        
Application of Internet Cache Protocol (ICP), version 2
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2187

the only missing part for this tool is the ICP Option Flags
that can be flaged with ICP_QUERY

ICP_FLAG_HIT_OBJ 0x80000000  
ICP_FLAG_SRC_RTT 0x40000000  

they are being flagged in the the fifth part of the packet called options:
it starts on the 64 bit and ends in the 95 bit.

as for now there is'nt really good use for these flags and because the are
missing some age parameters i prefer to let the http layer to handle the cache fetching.
