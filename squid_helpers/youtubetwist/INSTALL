WHAT IN THIS FOLDER
=
* 2 squid instances config sample files
* 2 GreasySpoon REQMOD scripts in java
* 1 startup script for squid in any version (not very clean)
* 1 openrc scripts that calles the startup script
* 1 openrc script to start GreasySpoon ICAP server
* 1 mysql structure file with user (edit the file as you wish and run as root)

Things that you need to think of:
-
you can run two instances of squid from the same exact binay file like this:
/usr/local/bin/squid -f /etc/squid/squid1.conf
/usr/local/bin/squid -f /etc/squid/squid2.conf

to control the instance add any command to the line like this:
/usr/local/bin/squid -f /etc/squid/squid2.conf -k reconfigure

based on the above are the startup scripts of squid in this folder.

GreasySpoon is based on java so you need to have it installed.
dont be afraid of GreasySpoon java exceptions output in terminal\stderr because it has some that are not really related to any problem.

if you create a an internal domain such as youtube.squid.internal it dosnt mean that you must have it but it's better to have it running on testing so you can get debug data.
in a case of TPROXY setup you must use some real ip that is routable througth the chained proxy for this domain... in the first squid hosts file.

the GreasySpoon scripts are based on an squid server called "sql1" change the ip as you wish.
also use any user and password you want for the sql server.

as for the scripts that runs the sqlQuery in the java methods they run the next sql procedures:
(read a bit on it)

CREATE PROCEDURE `seturl`(
IN vid varchar(4000),
IN uri varchar(4000)
)
BEGIN
 REPLACE INTO `temp`
 (videoId, url) values 
 (vid,uri);
END

CREATE PROCEDURE `geturl`(
IN _id VARCHAR(2000) )
BEGIN
SELECT url FROM temp WHERE videoId = _id ;
END


Installation
-
install mysql + squid + jre on the machine
create a db based on the sql file(understand it first).
download GreasySpoon and java jdbc connector.
put jdbc connector in the ./lib/ directory for the scripts to use it.
change the startup script that comes with greasyspoon and fix the jre location.
login into greasyspoon interface and change admin password!!!
install the java reqmod scripts into greasyspoon.
config 2 squid instances. 
(you can use the my  proxy_hb_check helper to check that state of a proxy and an acl that will let squid serv the content in a case that the second proxy is down or not server right the content).
##important thing is to firewall GreasySpoon ICAP port (1344) because it has no other way to block access into the service in any level.

GreasySpoon has a nice testing tool that runs every time you save a script in the web interface and you can see the debug and service logs for it to perform well.
it takes about couple of seconds for GreasySpoon to fully load so dont panice.
